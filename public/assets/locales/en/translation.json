  "about_desc1": "Prior to the enactment of the Police  Act of  1861, the Punjab  Police was known  as  “Military  Police Force”   and  it  consisted   of  8100 men.  Out of these, 5400 were  infantry divided into six Battalions  and the remaining  2,700 were the cavalry. The  Punjab, the sword-arm of India, however, needed a superior force for its internal administration. The Police Act of 1861came into force in Punjab with effect from  the 1st January, 1890.",
  "about_desc2": "The Police Training School was established in the Phillaur Fort by a Home Department  notification dated  the 9th  September, 1891, with a meagre staff under Mr. J.M. Bishop, I.P., Assistant District  Superintendent of  Police. The School started functioning with effect from the 1st January, 1892. Thus Punjab became  the first state in the country to establish  such a  school.  Most  of the other  training schools  were set up after the report of the Police Commission, appointed in 1902 by Lord Cuzon.",
